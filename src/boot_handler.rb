# administratively scoped multicast addresses are 239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

# Ignoring the cases where there is a collision while hasing the cluster name
# to multicast address. The probability of it is quite low, as MD5 technique
# is being used, and the last three parts of the ip address are generated by
# mapping such a hash to integers less than 235. The original idea was that
# when a collision occurs, we would increase the last part by 1. That is one
# reason why the addresses are generated between 0-235 and not 0-255, because
# whenever a collision occurs between two cluster names to a same number, then
# we can assign it 236, 237.. so on untill 255. The probability of 20 cluster
# names mapping to the same ip is practically 0. So 235 is fairly a same number
# to choose. Also, if any such cases arise, then we can use 236,237.. in the
# third part of the address, then in the second part. So the probability of 60
# clusters mapping to same ip is zero.


# Also, this application does not establish a direct TCP connection between the
# other nodes that are in the same cluster. One reason for this is the lack of
# time for the deadline, also it would require immense amount of time and precision
# in development, which is practically not possible for a two-day assignment. But
# the general idea is to make a mesh topology among the nodes in the same cluster,
# instead of multicast messages. This will make it easier to fetch the results from
# other nodes in the cluster. Here, the communication is asynchronous.
